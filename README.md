# Cyber-News-Bot-For-Discord V2
This bot displays latest news from bleepingcomputer and posts it into a discord chat of your choosing. For clarification it will seem to do nothing at first only when you set a channel and when news is posted.

Commands:

@set-channel "name of channel"  - This sets the channel for the bot to use to display news. IMPORTANT bot will not do anything unless channel is selected. 

@remove-channel "name of channel" - Remove Channel for bot to use
